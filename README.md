## Usage 


This is a Rust program that measures the time it takes for a command to execute and play sound when command finishes. The program uses the `clap` crate to parse command line arguments and the `rusty_audio` crate to play audio files when the command finishes executing.

To use this program, you need to pass a command and its arguments as command line arguments to the program. You can also specify optional flags for appending to an output file and specifying an output file.

Here is an example of how to use the program:

```
wooshh sleep 10
```

It will give you the same result as time command but it play music :musical_note: ðŸ”Š
